1.Set up project:

First you should copy files from repository to your PC name your project and start.

Seconly we are going to configurate our framework to start working. Someone who know PHP can skip this moment.

2.Configuration:

We have 3 folders and index.php, this file is main thing. Open it. In switch you should add case and sites you need in your web site. We will come back to it. Those folders are very important. "conf" is folder for files connected with configuration our project, for example db connect. I put example connection in localhost with PDO. In "vendor" we should put adds of PHP like PHPMailer. In last folder named "src" we have files we need most. We have "graphic", where we put .png files or others ("<img>"). In "skelet" we have files like "main.php" those files we use in "index.php" they are like skelet of body. In "sites" we have files which are the undersites of our project. Last thing is "func.php", there we put our functions we will use in all code.

Work in progress...
